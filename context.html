    <p class="content is-size-5">
        <strong>Pre War Animation</strong><br> 
        Animation as an artistic medium goes back many centuries, even as far back as the 1600s where illustrations were projected onto a wall using a light source. However, animation as we know it wasn’t around until 1892 when Émile Reynaud used a longer image reel to produce the first short, animated film, only around five minutes long. <br><br>
        Animation in Italy specifically begins in the 1910’s. The first animated film ever produced in Italy was done by the futurist movement (or more specifically, the post WWI revival of the genre known as “il Secondo Futurismo”), who championed technology as the greatest form of art and sought to embrace it however they could. <br><br>
        “Vita Futurista” was produced in 1916 by various members of the movement. It was part animated, part live action, much like a film that will be discussed in a later section. Unfortunately, because the complete film was destroyed when Rome was bombed in 1943, the only remnants of this work are a few stills from the film. <br><br>
        The other pre-war animated work of note was produced in 1936 by director Romolo Bacchini during the regime of Mussolini- when art was limited to what had government approval, but Mussolini himself did not go out of his way to limit obscure or “unofficial” art styles like animation. <br><br>
        Thus, Bacchini’s work “Le Avventure di Pinocchio," an animated retelling of author Carlo Collodi’s 1883 work of the same name, was set at the time to be the longest animated film but was unfortunately abandoned due to budget cuts and production costs. This is a shame, especially considering that if it had come to fruition, it would have been the first feature length animated film, beating out Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarves by a year.
        <br><br>
        <strong>WW2, The Resistance War and Neorealism</strong><br>
        Unsurprisingly, cinema was affected by the second World War. The Neorealist movement in particular was born out of a need to show the reality of humanity- a demonstration of the world as it is, not as people wanted it to be.  <br><br>
        This is in stark contrast to what Mussolini had been trying to accomplish during the regime and especially during the war. Namely, that Italy was a great prosperous nation, a “return” of the Roman Empire. <br><br>
        Neorealist film demonstrated this to be a lie, and a big one at that. Destitute people looking for work, cramped living spaces with large families juxtaposed the grandiose architecture style championed by Il Duce, and most particularly, a focus on children- and how they view the world, as a big part of fascism was education of the youth. <br><br>
        This last aspect in particular stands out the most, as it is the fuel behind the first and only animated Neorealist work. It is an important stepping stone on the journey of Italian animation because although the work itself is not very widely known, it begins to make a point about what animation as a medium can offer to the world of cinema.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The 60s and the Western</strong><br> 
        As Neorealism began to fall from favor a bit into the late 1950s, the Western- a genre drawing heavily from the works of the 1950s and its tales of ancient myths and settings. In addition, the western was a genre that, at the time, was quickly falling out of popularity with international audiences. It needed a push, a tweak, something that would truly revitalize the genre. <br><br>
        The genre was not the only thing in need of revitalization either, as the Italian film industry during the early 1960s was in the throes of a crisis, less and less people were going to see films. In addition, the country itself was undergoing social transformation, between the quickly industrializing north, and all the migration that came with it. <br><br>
        It was during this time that Sergio Leone, pioneer director of the Italian Western, found inspiration with a Western he saw, and became determined to make the genre his own.  <br><br>
        At the same time, Italy would also see its most prolific animator come onto the scene. Bruno Bozzetto was a young man at the time who had only produced a short work in 1958 called “Tapum! The Weapons Story.” <br><br>
        Leone and Bozzetto, separately, yet simultaneously, began work on their own brand of the Western genre in 1964. And while Leone made more sequels in the Western genre after “A Fistful of Dollars,” Bozzetto switched gears and began working in other genres, continuing to use and innovate animation.
        <br><br>
        <strong>The 70s and the Comedy</strong><br> 
        Alongside the Westerns of the 1960’s, another genre began to emerge in Italian cinema, the Comedy. At its inception, the comedy was primarily used to entertain- to provide humor for the sake of humor. As the 1970’s came about, comedy began to shift, no longer was it solely for entertainment, but satire and criticism. <br><br>
        But why so critical? Italy during the 1970s saw economic crisis and rise in political tension and corruption. The Italian people reacted in many ways, usually banding together through demonstration. The most notable of these groups were revolutionary and terrorist groups- fueled by the idea that the only way for true social change to occur was through violent demonstration and protest. It was an idea very closely associated with Marxist Communism. <br><br>
        These terrorist groups gave way to the “Anni di Piombo” (“The years of the bullet”). <br><br>
        Thus, reflecting society, Italian Comedy had the quality of being grotesque, with biting sarcasm. Where once Neorealism sought to show society as it was, comedy was more interested in exaggeration, and what it said about society. <br><br>
        What is interesting about this development is that Animation by its very nature is built on exaggeration, which makes it the perfect medium for such a genre.
