    <h1 class="title">Western Page</h1>
    <p class="content is-size-5">The Western- a genre full of gunslingers, outlaws, and tumbleweeds. The "Spaghetti Western" genre was made famous in the 1960s thanks to films by renowned director Sergio Leone. Through his methods of cinematography, Leone brought the American Frontier to life, displaying vast and immersive settings as well as creating the lone wanderer hero we have come to know and love. <br><br>
    Although the first Western film- A Fistful of Dollars (or Per un Pugno di Dollari in the Italian release)- was released in 1964, Italian animator Bruno Bozzetto claims to be the true inventor of the Italian Western genre, as production of his animated film West and Soda began production before Leone. However due to the time and methods used to produce the film, West and Soda released a year after A Fistful of Dollars. <br><br>
    What is interesting is that although both claim to be the first in the genre, the films are so vastly different. As A Fistful of Dollars takes the more dramatic approach to the genre and West and Soda leans heavily into the comedic aspect. So what do these two films contribute to the genre as a whole?

        <p class="content is-size-5">
            <strong>A Fistful of Dollars</strong><br>  
            Interestingly, the film opens with an animated gunfight scene as the opening credits play. This moves immediately into a medium shot of the main protagonist of the film on horseback, a shot that will occur several times during the film. <br><br>
            After witnessing a boy separated from his mother, he rides into a town where he is almost immediately shot at. He reveals himself to be a man of few words- an exemplification of the Western genre. And further, when he learns that there are two gangs that control the town, he comes up with the idea to “stay in the middle.” <br><br>
            He pulls the strings to put both gangs against one another to re-unite the family he met at the beginning of the film. During this time, one gang is brutally wiped out in a shootout, and almost immediately after, the final confrontation happens. <br><br>
            In this final confrontation, we are given a series of long shots and close ups. These continue as a back-and-forth pattern as the main villain fails to kill the protagonist thanks to makeshift body armor made from scrap metal. The entire time, the protagonist antagonizes the villain, asking why he’s having so much trouble.<br><br>
            In a quick flick of the wrist, all but the main villain is wiped out in a series of gunshots. And after the final duel between the characters. The protagonist leaves on horseback, echoing the opening scene of the film.
            <br><br>

            
            <strong>West and Soda</strong><br>
            After a short opening scene, during which the environment is established and literally “drawn” in, we are introduced to the main villains of the film Slim and Ursus, who cause trouble at a local tavern before leaving. After this, one more villain- the Big Boss- is established. <br><br>
            After causing havoc for Clementina, a local farmer with the only well-producing land in the whole area, the main protagonist- a lone wanderer named Johnny- arrives. Due to some past trauma, it is revealed he no longer uses his guns to fight. <br><br>
            This gets him into a bit of trouble when he crosses paths with the villains and ends up in a series of situations that gets him into trouble with Clementina- who tells him to leave. However, when he later finds out that she was kidnapped, he dons all black attire (in an amusing scene where he narrates the clothing as he equips it) and returns to save her. <br><br>
            The last portion of the film is Johnny being the usual Western hero, complete with heroism, a duel, and deadly aim. Yet there is also a good amount of humor dispersed throughout the whole encounter, setting the experience apart from watching just a regular western.

                The scene opens the morning after the main villains Slim and Ursus come in to cause trouble for Clementina. The roof is full of holes and thus water is seen dripping through the roof into a barrel. Further, we get a medium shot of the rooster, who, having been tired out from the events of the night prior, passes out mid crow. <br><br>
                The camera then shifts to a medium shot of the three anthropomorphized cows of the farm sleeping on the porch. The camera then moves into a close-up of the three of them as one of them applies makeup. There is then a slight panic as they spot another rider in the distance, and one of the cows sounds an alarm (something like a bomb siren). The rest of the farm scurries around in a panic, including the dog who is always seen drinking out of a flask. <br><br>
                As the rider approaches, there is a back and forth shot between Clementina, pointing a rifle out of the doorway, and the rider who comes more and more into view. She counts to three, but being too afraid to pull the trigger, never quite reaches it.<br><br>
                This is also because before she gets the chance to make up her mind to shoot, the rider on the horse falls off in a very animated and exaggerated way. Up to this point, there has been no music, just the ambient sound of nature and the dialogue of the characters. But as Clementina approaches the fallen man, an almost somber violin theme begins playing.<br><br>
                The two begin conversing in back-and-forth close ups. When he reveals that he has rode for 1381 miles, he begins to stand up. When he does, we are given a medium shot that follows him as he struggles in a series of outlandish walks until he finally collapses back on the ground.<br><br>
                As the two begin conversing once more, all we see is the rider get flipped over on the ground and dragged across the ground. He flirts with her a bit too as he reveals his name- Johnny. And the scene ends with a wide shot of the farm.

                As the scene opens, we get a close-up of Johnny, blurred by the glare of the sun behind him, walking into the town, with accompanying music that follows Johnny’s slow walking cadence. <br><br>
                The shot alternates from seeing him from the front to from the side. Each time we see Johnny from the side, more and more of the townspeople show up in the background, popping out from behind doorways, windows, and pillars. Johnny, now walking with an entire cheering crowd behind him, waves at the camera and breaks the fourth wall to a degree.<br><br>
                There is a quick cut to show a close up of the two gunmen. The taller of the two, Slim, shows off snake-like features in a mischievous grin. There is then a brief exchange of dialogue between the men before they stand silent staring at one another, hands ready by their guns. There is an interesting bit of framing here, where the camera is at a low angle behind the villains, such that Johnny is either framed in the space between them or between their legs<br><br>
                There is a tense moment where none of the men make a move, until Johnny begins twirling around like a ballerina with additional sparkle sound effects- which merits cheers from the crowd. Following this is a slow scene where there is a close up of the men’s hands as they slowly reach for their weapons, one finger at a time.<br><br>
                And just when it seems like they are about to draw and fire, Johnny instead pulls out a violin and plays it wildly, causing Slim to begin wildly vibrating, and the crowd to once again cheer. Ursus begins roaring like a lion to which Johnny pulls out a whip and chair like a circus master. There is another interesting fourth wall break here, where a candy salesman walks through with a “West and Soda” sign.<br><br>
                After more antics by Johnny, including blindfolding himself and juggling the chair, the two villains think they see their chance and open fire, to which Johnny fires backwards at them while standing on his head. One of the villains shatters like a porcelain pot, and the other takes a moment to fall, before attempting to get up by firing his gun. The scene ends with a wide shot of the crowd cheering.

            <strong>Comparison:</strong><br>
            The most noticeable difference between these two films is the usage of humor. A Fistful of Dollars had a few one-liners here and there, but for the most part the film felt like it was taking itself seriously. West and Soda on the other hand, went fully into the realm of comedy and exaggeration. To some degree, West and Soda could be seen in the lens of the early era of Italian Comedy, where it is primarily to entertain rather than make a point. <br><br>
            The main protagonists are similar- playing the fool for a bit, pretending that they are not the expert gunmen that they actually are. <br><br>
            In A Fistful of Dollars specifically, the protagonist spends less time playing a fool and establishes early on that he is a force to be reckoned with, but he does not just outright go and take on the gangs. It feels like this is more to engage the audience as if to make them continually ask “what is he planning?”<br><br>
            On the other hand, in West and Soda, Johnny plays the fool for most of the film but uses his wits to get himself out of a scenario without needing to use his weapons. It is only after Clementina is eventually kidnapped that he becomes focused and determined.<br><br>
            Another aspect that defines West and Soda from its predecessor is the usage of anthropomorphism to make even the creatures in the film characters. The three cows for instance all have different personalities and help deliver exposition in a straightforward and meaningful way. Another example are the ants that attack Johnny when he is captured in the desert. The ants are given a personality, as though they are an actual army with wills and strategies, which makes for some pretty good jokes as well.<br><br>
            In all, West and Soda feels complimentary to A Fistful of Dollars and the Western genre in general. The animated medium allows for additional characterization. Where one film might use the silence of a scene to build tension, the other will take that tension and turn it on its head, so that instead of a dramatic ending to the scene, there is instead a punchline.
