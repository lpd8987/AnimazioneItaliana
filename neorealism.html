    <h1 class="title">Neorealism</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">"Show reality as it is, not as it ought to be"</h2>
    <p class="content is-size-5">Neorealism- a film genre defined by its brutal, yet realistic portrayal of everyday life during and after the Resistance War (1943-45) in Italy. This genre defined a generation of films and directors, and its impact would be felt long after it fell out of popularity (Brunetta). Although most of the films were done in live action, there is one example of animated Neorealism. But how faithful could an animated movie be if the goal is to portray reality?<br><br>
    Animator Francesco Maurizio Guido- using the pseudonym “Gibba” throughout his career in animation- set out to answer just that. Early in his career in 1948, he released an animated film just over 11 minutes long called “L’Ultimo Sciuscià,” centered on a poverty-stricken young boy selling cigarettes on a street corner, whereupon antics ensue. His intent was to try to introduce animation as a medium that could address more serious themes rather than simply be for entertainment, as most animation was centered on at the time. (Classic Cartoons)<br><br>
    This film was released only a few short years after a film by a similar name- “Sciuscià”- by renowned Neorealist director Vittorio de Sica. Being in live action, the film is much longer than its animated counterpart, and is an excellent example of the Neorealism genre. (Brunetta)

        <h2 class="subtitle">Plot Summary and Analysis (Spoiler Warning)</h2>
        <p class="content is-size-5">
            <strong>Sciuscià</strong><br>
            Beginning with Sciuscià, the opening credits of the film contain a long shot of the inside of a building, seemingly with many cells like a prison. There is an abrupt transition to a medium shot of young boys watching horses. It is revealed that the film is centered around two young boys who work as shoe shiners and perform odd jobs to buy a horse. This already harkens to two facets of Neorealism, namely a focus on children, and a focus on the everyday person just trying to make a living.<br><br>
            After getting mixed up in an illegal smuggling ring, the boys are sent to a juvenile prison. Suddenly the theme of children representing the future as portrayed in other Neorealist films of the time takes on a new, darker tone, as the viewer is shown many different boys in the prison. Many of these boys act more akin to hardened criminals than children.<br><br>
            Although the relationship between the boys begins strong, it quickly goes downhill when the older of the two is beaten and “snitches” on the men who gave them the job that landed them in prison. The relationship deteriorates, and by the end of the film, the two boys are at each other’s throats, and one is killed in the conflict as the police close in on them.<br><br>
            The scene is very dramatically shot, with a medium shot when the two are fighting, a long shot of the fallen boy, and a pan out as the film ends. All of which is done in a low light. Although this is technically because the scene is taking place in the night, it drives home how dark the scene really is. And unlike other Neorealist films, where there is either a sort of hopeful or indifferent ending. The ending here just feels hopeless, perhaps meant to make a statement about the prison system and how it turns innocent children into actual criminals.<br><br>
            
            <strong>L’Ultimo Sciuscià</strong><br>
            This film, though a bit more lighthearted than Sciuscià, is equally as dark. The film opens with a young boy standing on a corner selling cigarettes with his trusty dog companion. Again, like the other film, the Neorealist trait of focusing on children and upon the everyday person come forth. Upon meeting an interested and friendly couple, they are spotted by a police officer and chased (likely for selling illegal or suspected stolen goods).<br><br>
            This scene is quite lively and even comical at times, as the personification of the dog and the exaggerated movements of the characters, coupled with the framing creates a very dynamic scene. Though it does lose some of the “grounded in reality” feeling that Neorealist films are so focused on. <br><br>
            After this very chaotic scene there is a transition to the boy and his dog at home. It is made very quickly apparent that they are destitute due to the dilapidated look of the house and lack of food in the cupboards- aside from old bread which the boy happily shares with his dog before going to sleep.<br><br>
            This is where the animation medium really shines. The rest of the film before the final scene is a dream sequence where the boy climbs a ladder into the heavens where he begins collecting stars. He collects a lot, making special care to grab some to share with his dog. <br><br>
            However, before he leaves, he is told by an otherworldly voice that the only way he is allowed to keep those stars is to stay there in the heavens. He eagerly agrees, before the scene shifts back to the boy’s room, where it is revealed that the boy has died in his sleep as his dog literally (again, personified through the animated medium) cries for him.<br><br>

            <p class="content is-size-5"><strong>Scene Analysis 1 - The Return Home (4:25)</strong><br>
                This scene, where the boy and his dog return home come immediately after a very fast paced chase scene. This shift in speed is noticeable, changing from a chase to an almost marching speed. This is also reflected in the music which matches the rhythm of the walking characters. The music maintains a similar speed throughout the whole scene.<br><br>
                Simultaneously, through the contrast of the black and white and the main characters being shown only by their silhouettes, the emphasis becomes on the background. The background pans left as the characters move right giving a parallax effect in the animation. The background looks almost desolate, but only because of the barren trees.<br><br>
                As they reach the house, it is revealed that the reason that the characters are only silhouettes is because they are in the dark, and the boy cannot see his dog in the dark. As the two enter the house, the camera zooms in to the wall and then the camera is inside, angled facing toward the door.<br><br>
                It is never directly addressed by the characters, but through the context clues of the boy shivering as he walks inside and then sneezing as he lights the candle seem to indicate either that the boy has some sort of sickness, or it is simply very cold in the house.<br><br>
                The camera changes angle yet again as we are shown the boy looking into his cupboard to see that there is nothing, but a piece of half-eaten bread and an empty can. As the boy struggles to break the hardened bread, the camera shifts to watch the dog fighting a mouse. This interaction continues until the mouse intimidates the dog into leaving it alone.<br><br>
                The boy then shares his bread with the dog, only getting two bites while his dog gets most of it. The scene then ends as the two fall asleep with the wind whistling.
            </p>
            <p class="content is-size-5"><strong>Scene Analysis 2 - The Dream (8:25)</strong><br>
                Immediately after the two fall asleep, the scene shifts to the boy looking up into the sky. He then climbs the ladder, and the camera pans around, again looking around the background as the boy looks at the stars.<br><br>
                The camera focuses on the boy on the ladder again, as suddenly it begins moving upward. As the boy climbs, we are given several different camera angles to emphasize just how high up the ladder is until eventually the boy reaches the stars. <br><br>
                As the boy explores, we get a mix of medium shots and close ups. He picks up an armful of stars until he is eventually satisfied. Before he leaves though, he has a back-and-forth conversation with a disembodied voice, who tells him he may only keep the stars he has collected if he stays. When he agrees, the camera fades out and returns to the boy’s home, where it is revealed that the boy has died in his sleep, either due to the cold or hunger (or maybe both).

            <strong>Comparison:</strong><br>
            Both films have similar concepts, but the stories have very different outcomes. For example, Sciuscià, being the live action film, is a lot more grounded in reality- it is easier to see it as a believable story. L’Ultimo Sciuscià attempts to truly have the viewer suspend their disbelief through the exaggerated motions. In a way, this is a good way of showing a scene through the eyes of a child. When compared to the Neorealist film The Children are Watching Us- in which the POV changes to represent the world through a child’s eyes, this film takes it a step further by showing the viewer perhaps a reality as seen through a child’s imagination. <br><br>
            Additionally, both films have the main protagonists chased by the law in some way, the difference lies in how the chase ends. In Sciuscià, the main protagonists are sent to a juvenile prison, whereas in L’Ultimo Sciuscià, the protagonist escapes. Looking at the films in this way, one might almost wonder what would happen if the scenarios were reversed. What if the two boys in Sciuscià were not captured by the police? What sort of life would they live after purchasing a horse? Or in L’Ultimo Sciuscià, what if the boy and his dog were captured by the police? Would the boy and his dog be separated? Would the boy’s health perhaps improve if he is taken into a public institution?<br><br>
            Given that L’Ultimo Sciuscià is the only example of animated Neorealism, perhaps the biggest contribution made to the genre is giving a new perspective to how the children are represented in the film. Not as simply people trying to live their lives, but as children with vivid immaginations.
