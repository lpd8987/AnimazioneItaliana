    <p class="content is-size-5">Comedy- that genre that allows us to laugh and poke fun at the absurdities of life. Originally a genre meant simply for entertainment in Italy, this genre evolved in the late 60’s to be more bitterly sarcastic. The films became meant less for entertainment, and more to emphasize the more grotesque elements that made up society at the time. <br><br>
    This genre is really well portrayed in the film Fantozzi, filmed by director Luciano Salce in 1975. This film is meant to be a parody of the struggles of the middle-class worker. Ugo Fantozzi, displeased with his job and family, embarks in a series of antics, often with comical gags or recurring jokes along the way.  <br><br>      
    As for an animated counterpart, we have another film by animator Bruno Bozzetto known as Allegro non Troppo. This film is considered to be one of his best works, combining live action scenes with smoothly and rhythmically animated scenes to create a parody of Walt Disney’s famous work Fantasia. Although the purpose of the film is to parody Fantasia, we still see the social commentary of Italian comedy come forth.

        <p class="content is-size-5">
            <strong>Fantozzi</strong><br>
            This film is told in a series of short chapters about the unfortunate yet loveable Ugo Fantozzi in a film meant to display the absurdity of life and struggles of the middle class. <br><br>
            In the opening scene of the film, after receiving a call from Fantozzi’s wife, the workers in the supercorporation that he works for open up a wall, realizing they accidentally sealed him in there a few weeks prior.<br><br>
            The film has a lot of fun chapters, often with moments where Fantozzi’s luck is just absent. However, despite this, there are scenes that show that he does still try to be a good person. For example, when his daughter was made fun of for her looks, Fantozzi is quick to reassure her and build up her confidence. In another scene, he begins actually trying at a game of billiards having found inspiration from his wife.<br><br>
            However, this is also in contrast to Fantozzi’s goal in the film, winning the affection of one of his coworkers, who, when he realizes that she is not interested in him, switches his job and joins the communist party.<br><br>
            This leads to him hating his job and egging the business, and when he is eventually stopped by the boss, he finds solace in getting to swim in his private fish tank.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Allegro non Troppo</strong><br>
            This film, like Vita Futurista mentioned previously, is a hybrid film. It is told in a series of live action and animated shorts, where the live action scenes are meant to be comedic and the animated scenes provide the comedy.<br><br>
            The film begins by breaking the fourth wall a bit, as a narrator explains that it is every animator’s dream to be able to animate music. They find an animator, who has inexplicably been locked away in a dungeon, and set him up at an animation table in front of an orchestra.<br><br>
            Between each animated scene, there is usually an interaction between the conductor and the animator who attempt to outwit and prank one another, the animator also has several interactions with a girl sweeping the stage. <br><br>
            As for the animated scenes, many of them are used as satire poking fun of industrialism- which is interesting considering that Italy at the time is adapting to rapid industrialization.<br><br>
            By the end of the film, the conductor has had enough of the animator’s antics, as the animator draws him and the girl as a prince and a princess and they fly away. Meanwhile, the conductor and the narrator talk about their idea for the next hit animated film, which ends up being a jab at Disney’s Snow White.<br><br>

                This scene, with all action being done to the beat of Slavic Dance No. 9, opens with a close up of the animator drawing a scene, which, as the color fades in becomes a long wide shot of a mountain occupied by small cavemen.<br><br>
                One of them descends the mountain and begins making a house. When the others see that he has made a house, they all descend and do the same. This sets the rhythm for the whole rest of the scene, where the one character will do one thing to the cadence of the music, and then as the rest of the orchestra chimes in, the rest of the characters will copy him. <br><br>
                This process repeats throughout the song, first when they build their city up from nothing. Then it takes a turn as the first character realizes he can use the people’s willingness to follow his every move to his advantage, even going so far as to do crazy things like dance around with an umbrella and eat a wooden mallet. <br><br>
                When he has the people all lined up, there is a shift as suddenly he becomes a general and does a salute which is very similar to the Nazi’s salute during World War II. He then attempts to lead his new soldiers off a cliff, but they do not follow him. In fact, the scene ends with them mocking him and the animator laughing at his antics. <br><br>
                The whole scene seems to be warning about the danger of blindly following the most powerful person of the time.

                This scene is widely regarded as the best scene in the whole film. It is very slow and methodical. It follows the story of a drop of soda that gains sentience, and as time marches ever onward, we see more and more creatures join the march. <br><br>
                To describe each and every iteration of the ever growing march of animals would be much longer than just watching the scene, so I will start where the satire does. <br><br>
                Eventually, an ape joins the march and establishes itself as the villain of the story. The scenery from that point begins to get darker and darker until eventually man-made structures begin to appear, beginning with the pyramids and ending at skyscrapers until suddenly the tallest structure of all reveals itself as mankind. <br><br>
                The last shot of the scene is particularly haunting, with a smirking face which crumbles and the ape once more shows itself, as if to say that we have not truly evolved.

        <p class="content is-size-5">
            <strong>Comparison:</strong><br>
            Both films fit excellently into the Italian comedy genre thanks to their satirical messages. In Fantozzi, the commentary seems to be even more exaggerated than the animation, which is surprising. It feels very cartoonish, like a more extreme version of the Three Stooges, but only one of them is taking any sort of hit. <br><br>
            In addition, Fantozzi seems to take a more satirical stance about the state of being a middle-class worker specifically in the time it was made, while Allegro non Troppo satirizes the then recent industrialization of Italy, as well as touches on some of Resistance War and post war Italy (as seen in an animated segment focusing on a cat walking around a bombed-out house). <br><br>
            In a way, it could be a satire of the history of Italy, at least part of it. And I think it is at this point where Italian fiction cinema and animation seem to almost merge- animation by its very nature is exaggerated in its movements and punchlines, and these are tenets of Italian comedy.
