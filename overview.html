    <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4"><em>"Why is Italian animation Seminal? How does it compare to Italian fiction cinema?"</em></h2>
    <p class="content is-size-5">Italian fiction cinema has a rich history from the Neorealism in the time of the Resistance War and post WW2 in the 40s and 50s, to the classical western genre of the 60’s, and the comedies of the 1970s and 80s. However, during this time, it seems like the focus of study always lands on the live-action films- a medium that is grounded in reality and limited by the technology and sets of the time. Granted, these limitations allowed for the creation of impactful films with nuanced and insightful social commentary behind them. But could similar stories put into a different medium yield a similar result? <br><br>
    Animation is a fascinating medium of filmmaking. It allows the director ultimate freedom in their depiction of a subject- not restrained by sets or cameras, only by the animator’s imagination. And in the case of Italian Animation, the genres mentioned above take on a new aspect, pushing the boundaries of what each genre has to offer. But how does animation do so? That is what this website seeks to discover through analysis of key films from each genre in both the live action and animated mediums. <br><br>
